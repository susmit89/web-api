	"metadata": ["Shortcoming of having a small training dataset is overfitting the model, resulting in degrading performance on the test data. Popular technique is to use the pretrained model which has been trained on a larger dataset. Pretrained model has a good representation network. We initialize the  parameters of our model using a pretrained network and then fine tune it by training on our smaller dataset. Both transfer learning and self-supervised learning uses pre-trained models trained on large source dataset and then fine tuned on target dataset. So which one is preferred?"],

In transfer-learning, model is pre-trained through supervised learning in which dataset from source is annotated by humans while in self-supervised learning, model is pre-trained unsupervised without labelled data. Unsupervised  learning is carried out by performing some auxiliary tasks set by humans. Best example is the BERT NLP model which performs auxiliary tasks like predict the present word from past words or predict present word from future words or predict word from both present and past words in a given sentence. Data is not labelled rather BERT generates labels. Another example is autoencoders which reconstruct the source image."]
