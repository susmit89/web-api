Network intelligence is (logically) centralized in software-based SDN controllers, which maintain a global view of the network. As a result, the network appears to the applications and policy engines as a single, logical switch. With SDN, enterprises and carriers gain vendor-independent control over the entire network from a single logical point, which greatly simplifies the network design and operation. SDN also greatly simplifies the network devices themselves, since they no longer need to understand and process thousands of protocol standards but merely accept instructions from the SDN controllers.”"],

The approach enables multiple organizations to collaborate on the development of models, but without needing to directly share secure data with each other. Over the course of several training iterations, the shared models get exposed to a significantly wider range of data than what any single organization possesses in-house. In other words, FL decentralizes machine learning by removing the need to pool data into a single location. Instead, the model is trained in multiple iterations at different locations."]
