The requested services are provided in an accurate configuration and on an accelerated timeline. They are bound by IT's policies but without IT's manual involvement. The main advantage of automated provisioning in the cloud is quite simply the automation, predictability, and speed of preparing a resource for an internal or external customer.

Developers have to justify the resources and wait for the capacity to free up from some other project; wait for someone in IT to implement specified configuration, and troubleshoot it if configured wrong. Finally, days or even weeks later, the developer has an environment ready for testing. This is inefficient and time-consuming."]
