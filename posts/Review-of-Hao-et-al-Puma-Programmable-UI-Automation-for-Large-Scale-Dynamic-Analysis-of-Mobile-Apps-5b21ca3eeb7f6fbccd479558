	"metadata": ["Mobile app ecosystems have experienced tremendous growth in the last few years. This has triggered research on dynamic analysis of performance, security, and correctness properties of the mobile apps in the ecosystem. Exploration of app execution using automated UI actions has emerged as an important tool for this research. However, existing research has largely developed analysis-specific UI automation techniques, wherein the logic for exploring app execution is intertwined with the logic for analyzing app properties."],

				"value": ["PUMA is good at event sequencing and automatic explorations. It could be good at reproducing because of its programmable ability. It is good at saving time especially in the case of regression testing, which is retesting done after some changes have been incorporated to previously tested PUMAscripts. Tests can be run at a fast pace repeatedly and the risk of human error is minimized, making it more effective. PUMA brings transparency. UI manipulation is abstracted so that it can be optimized with a proper rendering technique."]

And, if the UI changes dynamically, it might be a big problem. PUMA may be difficult for debugging. It may get more difficult as the complexity of the application increases. Integrating animations/transitions into data-driven frameworks is tricky and needs extra effort."]
